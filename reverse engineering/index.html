	    <p> Reverse engineering is the process of analyzing a system to understand its components, design, and functionality. In the context of security research, it involves examining software or hardware to identify potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors. 
            </p>

        <p>By breaking down a system into its constituent parts and analyzing their interactions, security researchers can gain valuable insights into its security posture, identify weaknesses, and develop strategies to mitigate risks.

     <h2>Penetration Testing Phases: Step by Step</h2>
	<ol>
	  <li>Scoping: Define the scope, goals, and objectives of the test. Identify the systems and networks to be tested and establish a clear understanding of the testing environment.</li><br>
	  <li>Reconnaissance: Gather information about the target, like domain names, IP addresses, and network infrastructure. If the target is an application, you would step through the functionality and observe how the application is intended to be used.</li><br>
 	 <li>Vulnerability Scanning: Use automated tools to discover live hosts, open ports, and services. It's like finding all the doors and windows of a building you want to break into. If an application is the target web application vulnerability scanning tools can be used to help identify any low hanging fruit.</li><br>
  	<li>Exploitation: An attempt to exploit vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or in the case of an application abuse a function to do things the developer did not intend, just like a real attacker would. This process could involve using known exploits and attack vectors or trying to find new ones.</li><br>
  	<li>Escalation: Attempt to escalate privilege of the vulnerability, either by chaining vulnerabilities and/or performing exploiting the host operating system.</li><br>
  	<li>Persistence: Aka pivoting, after a single host has been compromised the machine could be used to access other services or hosts using a process called pivoting.</li><br>
 	 <li>Reporting: Fun time is officially over, now it is time for the consultant to document the issues discovered in the above processes and present them in a report that documents the discovered issues, severity, risk, and a recommendation to fix any discovered vulnerabilities.</li>
	</ol>

     <h2>Taking Care</h2>
		<h3>Stay in Scope</h3>
		<p>As a penetration tester you are carrying out a controlled simulation; care must be taken to always adhere to the scope and not step outside of the agreed upon assessment scope.</p>
		<h3>Technical Contact</h3>
		<p>If issues or questions arise, always ensure you have a direct contact with the organisations technical contact. You may need to clarify an area of the scope or seek additional approval before executing a potentially disruptive exploit. Firewalls and WAF’s might cause issue during testing and require you to contact the client to add your testing IP on their allow list. </p>
	</div>

<section class="features">
	<div class="grid">
     <h2>Penetration Testing Tools</h2>
		<p>During an assessment multiple tools will be used depending on the phase of the test and type of pen test that is being performed.</p> 
		<p>An example of an indicative list of some pen test tooling for an infrastructure penetration test: </p>
		<ol>
	  	<li>Reconnaissance: Tools such as subfinder, Google dorks, Waybackurls, <a href="/blog/naabu-cheat-sheet/">Nmap</a>, <a href="/blog/nmap-cheat-sheet/">Naabu</a>, Shodan, recon-ng, TheHarvester.</li><br>
	  	<li>Vulnerability Scanning: OpenVAS, Nessus, Nuclei.</li><br>
  		<li>Exploitation: Exploit-db, Metasploit Framework, OpenVAS, Nessus, Nuclei.</li><br>
  		<li>Escalation: Typically privilege escalation is performed manually against appliances or operating systems, e.g., using a <a href="/blog/linux-local-enumeration-script/">Linux local privilege escalation script</a> or by performing this manually.</li><br>
  		<li>Pivoting: Again, this phase is performed manually and depends greatly on the target operating system which has been compromised, see our <a href="/ssh-meterpreter-pivoting-techniques/">pivoting cheat sheet</a> for more information.</li><br>

		<h3>What is Enumeration? </h3>
		<p>In the context of penetration testing, enumeration refers to the process of actively gathering information about a target system or network to identify potential vulnerabilities or weak points that could be exploited by attackers.</p>
		<p>Enumeration typically involves using various techniques such as scanning, probing, and querying to gather information about network services, system configurations, user accounts, and other relevant details. This information can then be used by the penetration tester to assess the security posture of the target environment and identify potential avenues for further exploitation.</p>

	<h3>What is Persistence? </h3>
		<p>In this context, "persistence" refers to the ability of an attacker to maintain access to a compromised system or network over an extended period without being detected. After gaining initial access through a vulnerability or exploit, an attacker may seek to establish persistence by deploying reverse shells, creating hidden user accounts, installing malicious software, or modifying system configurations to maintain access even after the initial breach has been remediated.</p>
	

		
		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		<p>In conclusion, penetration testing serves as a crucial pillar of proactive cybersecurity strategies, offering organizations a vital means to assess and fortify their digital defenses. By simulating real-world cyber-attacks, penetration testing provides invaluable insights into potential vulnerabilities, helping organizations identify and mitigate risks before they are exploited by malicious actors. From uncovering weaknesses in network infrastructure to evaluating the security of web applications and cloud services, penetration testing empowers organizations to proactively strengthen their security posture and safeguard sensitive data. Embracing penetration testing as a regular practice enables organizations to stay ahead of emerging threats, comply with regulatory requirements, and instill confidence in their ability to protect against cyber threats in an increasingly interconnected digital landscape.</p>
